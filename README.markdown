Problem Child Literary Magazine
===============================

For now, you'll find most of the information you'll want by visiting
problemchildmag.com.

Models
------

Check out the docs folder for some UML generated by [RailRoady](https://github.com/preston/railroady):

This is starting to look and feel pretty complicated. I think I might
remove some shortcuts that I built in. (For example, a person has an
attendee, which has a meeting. A person does not have a meeting. Same
with submission --> packlet --> meeting.)

About the developer
-------------------

This is my first solo rails project. I'm learning a lot.

Contributing
------------

To get this thing up and running in your own development environment,
you'll need to clone this project as well as [the ansible setup] and
[the ansible source]. (Ensure the ansible setup and the pcmag repos are
in the same parent directory). Also, make sure you have [Vagrant]
and [VirtualBox] installed. Then `cd` into the pcmag directory and
`vagrant up`.

Then go do some stretching/pushups/drinking. It'll be a bit of a wait.

Once it's done, you can `vagrant ssh` to get into the VM where
everything's installed. You'll probably want to

    rake db:setup
    rake db:test:clone
    rspec
    cucumber

To set up the dev and test db and run all the tests.
