    And I am on the meetings page
    When I follow "Schedule a new meeting"
    And I fill in the following:

      | Question | Does he love you?   |
    And I press "Create Meeting"
    Then I should see "Does he love you?"

  Scenario: Editor changes a meeting's question
    Given I'm in a position for the current magazine with the "orchestrates" ability
    And there is a meeting scheduled
    And I am on the meetings page
    When I follow "âš™"
    And I fill in "Question" with "What is the energy of your color?"
    And I press "Update Meeting"
    Then I should see "What is the energy of your color?"
