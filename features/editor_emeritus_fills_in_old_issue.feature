Feature: An Editor Emeritus enters submissions for an old issue
  As someone who once was editor
  I want to fill in the issues that were published while I was there
  So that I and everyone else can access them quickly & easily online.

  Scenario: I submit published works for an old issue
    Given a very old issue called "maps"
    And a current issue called "produce prints"
    Given I'm in a position for the "maps" issue with the "communicates" ability
    When I go to the submit page
    And I fill in the following:
      | Title     | Letters from Aching |
      | Body      | Dear Occupant: &câ€¦  |
    And I select "the maps issue" from "Issue"
    And I press "Submit!"
    Then "Letters from Aching" should be published
    And "Letters from Aching" should be on page 1 of maps
    And I should be on the submit page
    And I should see "Letters from Aching has been published and is on page 1 of the maps issue."
