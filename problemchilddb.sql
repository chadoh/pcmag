Itâ€™s hard to describe, but it can be described in a million ways. Itâ€™s like swallowing a piece of gum and knowing that it wonâ€™t be digested for another seven years. It kind of depresses you, you know? That piece of gum will be sitting in your stomach for seven whole years. At night, when you canâ€™t fall asleep, that gum will still be there. When youâ€™re on a roller coaster, screaming your lungs out, the gum will continue to be a part of you. But it has a certain uplifting feeling to it too, swallowing a piece of gum I mean. It gives you hope that youâ€™ll be alive in seven years, seven whole years â€“ 2,555 days, 6,1320 minutes, 3,679,200 seconds. If you count to 3,679,200 (Mississippi), that gum will be digested and you will be seven years older, wiser (dumber?), and seven years farther in distance maybe, but in time definitely, from where you are now. Oh, itâ€™s also like when youâ€™re driving with someone else on a highway. And theyâ€™re going really fast, I mean really fast. Like, trying to look cool fast. You know you should be worried, and maybe you are a little bit, but what you are the most is excited, thrilled, filled with a rush. You wanna know why? Because itâ€™s out of your control; the whole situation, all of the decisions, circumstances, consequences, itâ€™s all on the other person, the driver. Theyâ€™re responsible for your life; youâ€™re free for a while. All you can do is sit back and feel your stomach churn with nervousness and anxiety and enjoy it. Itâ€™s like knowing youâ€™ll never be six years old again, or twelve, or fourteen. You had your chance at that year and itâ€™s over, forever. And suddenly you have that responsibility again. It hits you hard with its best friend, reality. And you wonder if youâ€™re living in vain, if youâ€™re doing everything youâ€™re supposed to be doing. But what is that anyway? And you wish you were back in that car, hurtling toward nothing with nothing to worry about. And the gum is still sitting in your stomach, waiting for you to do something, accomplish something. She stops running and bends over, trying to relieve the cramp that twists and contorts her stomach and she wipes at the salty fluid cascading down her determined face. And now that sheâ€™s finally stopped, she can catch her breath in long, wheezing gasps. Sheâ€™s not metaphorically running away from her problems, her responsibility, her life. No, thatâ€™s not the moral of this story. She runs because her coach told her to run three miles a day. Thatâ€™s it. Simple explanation. She does what sheâ€™s told to do. But the gum is still being digested in her stomach. So do something about it, she tells herself. She doesnâ€™t know what something or it is, but itâ€™s the only advice that seems appropriate at the moment. She opens the door, walks up the stairs, enters her room, and records her time for the three miles. The times from yesterday, the day before, the day before that, and so on are scribbled down in their allotted spaces. Her times are decreasing steadily, as they should be. So sheâ€™s improving. Sheâ€™s doing what sheâ€™s supposed to be doing. It says so right there on the paper, physical proof. But the familiar feeling of apprehension overcomes her, so she stuffs a piece of Orbit into her mouth, chewing it for a few seconds, and swallows it right down. She sighs and feels relief. She has seven more years toâ€¦to do what? To make a difference? No, that sounds too clichÃ©. Seven more years of bad luck? No, there were no mirrors involved. We have seven more years to do something, to use time and life to our advantage, to let go of the responsibilities sometimes, but assume responsibility for them at other times, to make a year count, make seven years count, make our lives count.   \r\n','2008 Fall',10,8,'2008-11-11',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(59,'Danielle German','dhg5008@psu.edu','House of Worship','The lighting is different\r\nfluorescentâ€”instead of dim ambience;\r\nbut I can almost feel the wooden pew beneath my legs.\r\nThe scent of incense on carpeted altar.\r\nThe sermon becomes a mere buzzing in my ears.\r\nI zone out as I did back then,\r\nreduced to the most mundane of activities.\r\nMy youthful time in the house of god\r\nspent inspecting my nails and counting hats.\r\nAnd that was when I still believed.\r\nMy father says that only boring people feel bored\r\n--the biggest lie Iâ€™ve ever been told.\r\nBoring is priests and professors that expatiate\r\nas though they had all the time in the world.','2008 Spring',5,1,'2008-02-27',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(60,'Danielle German','dhg5008@psu.edu','Killer Cars','I have often fantasized\r\nabout killer cars.\r\nNot just the kind that give men a hard-on,\r\nones that take life away first chance they get.\r\n\r\nGo through the light\r\nand suddenly itâ€™s there:\r\ngrill slamming into the door\r\nglass and plastic flying.\r\n\r\nJust like that time on route 21.\r\nFour kids now gone\r\n--one decapitated.\r\nStupid boy trying to wow three girls\r\n\r\nby speeding up the ramp\r\nand side swiping the nearest Honda.\r\nOvercorrect to the left\r\nflip six times to the right.\r\n\r\nA boy who lost his head, now thatâ€™s\r\nkiller, as dead as my soul\r\nstill fantasizing under every green light\r\nabout death by killer cars.','2008 Spring',5,6,'2008-02-27',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(61,'Greg Bateman','geb5013@psu.edu','Woman Eating a Sandwich While Waiting for the Bus','She takes tiny bites, like a bird\r\npicking seeds out of a feeder;\r\nher heavy winter coat\r\nis filled with feathers.','2008 Spring',5,8,'2008-02-27',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(62,'Tristan Helms','tph5003@psu.edu','Euler\'s Recommendation','must go to my class, \r\nto differentiate stuff, \r\nI love to do math','2008 Spring',5,3,'2008-02-27',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(63,'Tristan Helms','tph5003@psu.edu','Dream is a five letter word','I study women.\r\nActually I do not.\r\nBut I would like to.','2008 Spring',5,5,'2008-02-27',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(64,'Chad Ostrowski','cao5021@psu.edu','An Unspoken Deal','Career fairs and Interviews all day: I wore a suit to classes.

It failed to greet them warmly. Sand blew onto sand-colored uniforms, dry tan betrayed by splashes of blue. The smattering of six-pointed stars formed a constellation too geometrically perfect for the sky. They surrounded an equally camouflaged tank slowly crawling over the dunes.\r\n\r\n	Captain Elijah Azriaâ€™s thoughts turned to numbers â€“ casualties, costs, reparations, and rewards. But they were all just numbers, as meaningless as the ones branded across his arm. What was real was in his hands â€“ the power encased in cold metal. His thoughts then turned to the past â€“ the deep red stains that would never wash out. His mind often wandered there during the monotonous repetition of marching. Miles lasted for years in which he relived the horrid past, his hatred ever growing. He tortured himself with the fruitless, self-destructive practice of asking what-ifs. What if the power resting between his hands, the power crawling slowly behind him, had been theirs? Could they have stopped what transpired?\r\n\r\nElijah, unable to carry the burden of wonder alone, often forced this question on his fellow soldiers. They all had different opinions on what their exact effect would have been. However, they united on a single point â€“ Elijahâ€™s preoccupations were unhealthy and strange. The soldiers claimed solidarity in the fact that they all joined the military for the same reason â€“ to forge a greater future for their people. Yet secretly, the others feared Elijahâ€™s motives did not match their own. They worried that some impossible dream of revenge on dead enemies impelled him. A collective silence on the matter told them the fear was mutual. Fear followed them like a spectre as day gave into the nightâ€™s advances. They set up camp.\r\n\r\nCaptain Elijah Azria slept and dreamed, but dreaming to him was merely a continuation of waking life. He saw the atrocities, felt the loneliness and hunger, and heard the sound beyond description â€“ the sound of spirits breaking. But more than anything he saw his motherâ€™s face. He let out a scream, trying to reach the ears of Hell through sheer volume and insistence. The only ears reached, however, were his own and his comradesâ€™. They asked him what the matter was, and he told them coolly of the nightmareâ€™s contents. The soldiers shared uncomfortable glances as Elijah recited his familiar vow of revenge. They had long given up on reasoning with him. Experience had taught them that the best approach was to let him give his piece. Well before Elijah ran out of words or hate, it was time to move out.\r\n\r\nThey marched. At some point in the afternoon, there was gunfire. Elijah lay unconscious in the sand, having seemingly taken a bullet to the chest in the midst of the chaos, but no one was sure. The men approached solemnly, expecting the worst. However, he awoke unscathed, having just been caught in the force of a blast. After a moment to collect themselves, they continued their incessant march.\r\n\r\nThe weather sought to halt them, but they persisted. Torrents of sand blurred the menâ€™s vision, except Elijahâ€™s. He saw with clarity the omnipresent image of his mother, forever out of his reach in spite of his eternal walking. His recollection of that time was blurry, limited to a few strong memories â€“ memories he once dreaded but grew to cherish. The memory of his mother in that demonâ€™s hands kept him firm on his path. They had taken her from him. He was sure of it.\r\nThe day became cold. Sand seemed to slowly give way to snow, but the men dismissed the phenomenon with science. However, there reached a point where the conversion of tan to white was undeniable. Logic seemed to dictate a pause in the march, but Elijah continued and the men followed in perfect formation. The tank slowly traversed the unexpected ice.\r\n\r\nThey noticed an indistinct background shape slowly taking form into something recognizable. They approached a symbol. In reality it was a building, but its power and significance had elevated it beyond reality. Elijahâ€™s head filled with a potent and boiling mixture of joy and rage; the scenery was all too familiar. His reaction was predictable, but none of the men could have faulted him without committing hypocrisy. They were all possessed by the same vengeful demon and advanced into Hell without pause.\r\n\r\nThe silent, inhuman tank was the first to cry out. With little effort an entrance was made and a path was cleared. The small group of men seemed to have the effect of a full-fledged army. They met little resistance and crushed what they found. Whether by luck or the enemyâ€™s poor aim, not a single bullet hit them. Regardless, Elijah seemed in sudden pain; gripping his chest, he fell. The men rushed to his side, but he quickly returned to his feet, though visibly shaken.\r\n\r\nSoon all traces of the enemy were gone, and the soldiers began the search for survivors. Elijah broke from the group with haste. He still gripped his chest and was blinded by bloodlust, but he disregarded eyesight. Memories of the walls came rushing back to him. He knew exactly where he was going, and somehow knew he would arrive at the perfect moment â€“ just in time to save his mother from the demonâ€™s grip.\r\n\r\nHe ran with inhuman speed in defiance of the pain and burst in on his mother and the faceless shadow in uniform he had hated for countless nightmares. In an instant, he fired his gun and finally looked on with clear eyes. In the brief eternity that followed, the American soldier fell to the ground, and his motherâ€™s expression turned from hope to horror. She looked at him with the same expression she had looked upon the murdering demons. As the moment reached its end, he noticed the pain in his chest had become unbearable. He fell to the ground, at a loss for thoughts on what was happening to him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Elijah Azria died from a single shot to the heart at 3:27 PM in the Israeli desert. His fellow soldiers felt great sympathy for whoever who would have to tell his mother that the son the Nazis took from her was finally lost completely.\r\n','2008 Spring',8,3,'2008-03-25',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(95,'Devin William Daniels','dwdjazz@gmail.com','Pheasants Under Glass***special formating**','The scholar and the minstrel meet for\r\ndinner, on a Sunday.\r\ntheir stomachs growl with\r\nHunger; havenâ€™t eaten\r\nfor a time.\r\n\r\nThe state checks havenâ€™t\r\ncome yet, but each\r\nother doesnâ€™t\r\nknow that\r\nand a tricky\r\nSituation\r\nsoon develops\r\nin short time.\r\n\r\n(You see where this is going,\r\nI am sure.

The word Philco must have meant something like â€œPhiladelphia Company,â€ but that was probably too simple.\r\nThe TV set picked up only two channels, and there were three major networks, so I missed a third of what was offered. I never watched Batman, for example, though I somehow knew the theme song. Once, I was caught by a classmate singing the Batman theme in the outfield during a softball game. It was an easy song, with one word, â€œBatman,â€ sung on different notes: â€œBatman! Batman! Batman!â€\r\nMy father didn\\\'t like most of the shows my brother and sister and I watched, so he tried to limit our viewing to one hour a night.

I got good at doing my math homework during commercials-one problem per 60-second break.\r\nThe Philco itself turned out to be vulnerable to lightning. During a summer storm, a bolt entered the antenna wire, shot through the box and sizzled in a huge spark between the bottom of the set and the table it was on. I was on the sofa, watching a show.

To avoid as much physical exertion as possible I decided to use the Blue Loop (which was more accurately referred to as the Campus Loop back then) to get from the computer labs in the Pollock library to the corner of College and Atherton. As it was summer, the Loop was not terribly crowded. There were a total of four passengers on the bus including myself, a number that only decreased with each stop. The girl sitting in front of me got off at College and Allen, one stop before mine, but left behind a pack of cigarettes. I eyed them curiously on the brief transit from Allen to Atherton and, upon my own departure, snatched them up.	It was the birth of a beautiful and illustrious bad habit.\r\nI still had five blocks to walk to my West College Avenue apartment. I spent the entirety of the hike contemplating the abandoned object. It was a pack of Marlboro Lights, and there were four left inside. I discarded them on my dresser when I arrived at my apartment, but their presence never left my mind. I knew they were dangerous, but they seemed so innocent and their sweet odor was inviting. Finally, my inquisitiveness got the better of me, and that evening I took one out of the pack, carried it out to the front porch, and lit it up.\r\nThe flame was brilliant, like a magic trick in which dollars and doves disappear. I knew I was supposed to inhale, but I didnâ€™t think that it would be so difficult and that I would end up sucking on it harder than a straw in a thick milkshake. No one explained to me that there was a right and a wrong way to smoke a cigarette and that without guidance, it was an easy mistake to make. I had lit the filter end.\r\nMy error was easy enough to identify so I simply fetched a second cigarette, mindful of which end to set on fire, and started anew. The first breath was like trying to inhale a Buick. Everything from my lungs to my lips said no in violent protestation. â€œBut they were free!â€ my thrifty mind responded, â€œdonâ€™t waste it!â€ So I proceeded, coughing and sputtering the whole time, until I had exhausted the entire stick. It was my first day as a smoker and I had already finished half of my pack.\r\nThe next evening, I tried another cigarette, and the evening thereafter, I had the other. Then, I bought my own pack, the corporeal complaints becoming less cogent with each inhalation. It became a tradition to end the day with a relaxing smoke on the porch, a tradition I have stuck with for years since.\r\nBefore this all happened, however, I was a fairly upstanding youth. As a product of the 80â€™s War on Drugs and the D.A.R.E. program, I was proud of my pharmaceutical free nature. I didnâ€™t drink alcohol, I didnâ€™t take any drugs, and I didnâ€™t smoke.\r\nCollege, however, opened my mind to the fact that I shouldnâ€™t condemn experiences without fully understanding them. I had met drinkers and smokers and drug addicts who told me things that Scruff McGruff neglected to mention. I still wasnâ€™t about to go all out on evening escapades of debauchery and self-destruction, but the seed for experimentation was there.\r\nA few weeks prior to my fateful find on the Loop, I had attended a party in which my sobriety was questioned. I explained that drinking just wasnâ€™t my scene, but without any other reasoning to back it up, I was unconvinced with my own answer. For the first time, I felt square.\r\nAnd so, when the opportunity to try new things presented itself, I seized it.\r\nConsciously, I know that smoking is bad for oneâ€™s health. It affects everything from lifespan to insurance rates. Itâ€™s also not the cheapest hobby available. Personally, I do not like the smell afterwards nor do I like the taste. But I do like watching the smoke trail from the end, and how the tip glows red at night. I like how the paper crackles as I take a long drag and I like seeing it exit my body when I exhale. I like flicking the ash; it takes skill and dexterity. I like how social it is, and the unspoken etiquette that smokers share.\r\nAs much enjoyment as I do get out of it, however, I still hesitate every time I run out about whether or not I should buy another pack. Iâ€™m torn between my knowledge of the harmful health effects and my mammalian predisposition for instant gratification.\r\nInvariably I end up walking to McLanahanâ€™s, shelling out a fiver and asking for just one more pack of Camels.

I wanna welcome you all to the seminar. Weâ€™re going to achieve majestic things here tonight people. Oh yeah! I guarantee you my brothers; you will leave this hall a different person, a better person, a walking monolith of development.\r\n     I see you all sitting there now, wretched and useless, unable to connect to history and social customs, moral values, and cuddling with loved ones. I was once like you, brothers. But I have discovered things that have changed me in a million emerald ways. I have let my mind wander on dancers and firelight, blue skies and open plains. I have talked to the poet and shaman, and I come before you know as an interpretive plaque from the four winds. Let me tell you, the poet and shaman is a pristine desert sky, a billowing cloud guided by an expert. The poet and shaman is a cooler, he is firewood and food for a week. He didnâ€™t disappoint me, and if you give me your trust and credit card numbers, I shall not disappoint you.\r\n     Thank you, thank you. Let me tell you, I understand you brothers. In long nights, long ago, I considered myself and the space I was occupying, and I retched at what I saw. I was a desolate soul in a desolate place. But even then, even at my lowest, I was aware of something special in me. Something handed down by God as a consolation price for the grey green limbs and heads that daily thrust around me. I knew I had to exploit this wondrous gift or drown amongst the garbage and trivia. One bright morning in June, I rented a Hyundai, and headed out of the city. Through valleys of silent creeping fear I drove, until finally I found a man. He was an old man, over eighty, and he worked as an ordained priest, in a modest visitors centre at Hole-in-the-Wall. Mysterious gusts of wind in me responded to him with passivity. He gave me things and I swallowed them, hoping to unlock the power vested in me. After forty days and forty nights I hadnâ€™t obtained a single thing from the old mans salty draughts. I began to feel restless and angry. \r\n    And then, as the evening drew near, the poet and shaman appeared. He was dressed in Armani and his black hair fluttered like dollar bills. He listened to me as I talked with the old man, a smile playing on his alabaster face. All at once, he interjected, and I knew I had found the man I looked for. Before the octogenarian had seemed so profound and simple, yet this man of wits and kisses exposed his confusion and celibate weakness. All emotion is a conclusion, my brothers, and my conclusion was- I loved this man. I went with him, and though I only spent one night in his awesome presence, he changed my life. We went stargazing that evening, trying to view the wild man in a rented four-wheel drive. He talked the whole night long, spinning words out like some cyclonic keeper of secrets. My mind, Iâ€™m ashamed to say brothers, couldnâ€™t keep up. When we finally went to bed, his words stretched out like slow trains behind my eyes, out of focus and unknowable. But the morning opened my mind, connected it to those mummies and artifacts he spoke of, and songs of birds and insects were also making the connection, as the land begun to percolate up into red and brown foothills. \r\n    Ohh my brothers. What I discovered out there in the desert was not how to be a servant of God, but how to become a God myself. \r\n    And thatâ€™s why weâ€™re here tonight isnâ€™t it? \r\n    Say it louder now! \r\n    Oh yes brothers, listen to me and gain the power to shape mans very desires! \r\n    You must already be aware of the power an executive has. Why, even as a copywriter you can kill anybody, posses slaves, and have total power to do what you think is best for them without having to justify your acts. So donâ€™t you worry about God now boys. The God thatâ€™s ignored your humble prayers, the God that punishes the organs that keep you alive. Forget all of them, my brothers, the gods and angels, the evil forces such as nutrition, exercise, and plenty of water.\r\n    Iâ€™m here to spread a new gospel, to unleash a hungry creature with a vigorous appetite. Iâ€™m here to help your hero achieve his goal, to think, create, and function. Iâ€™m here to teach you to live off the masses.\r\n  Together weâ€™ll feed them new, low fat, closer to god, recipes that love their bodies and keeps them unconscious. In addition to facials, new clothes and the occasional mocha latte, weâ€™ll sell them magical elements to spice up their dreary lives, three hairs of a horse, crystal balls, and a flying carpet. When thin is in fashion weâ€™ll pump them full of high fat food, and then slip them diets and doctors. When fat is in fashion, weâ€™ll make our food low fat, forcing them to buy our weight gain pills, which - I need hardly say - will be beautifully expensive. Brothers, we shall have choirs of naked chorus girls sing our slogans, their tight cunts glistening as they march down Broadway!

We faced cliffs and slopes, and, towards the top, they got so steep that it\'s a good thing the load on the dolly was getting lighter and lighter, or we might not have made it.

This season we are dedicating a team of students to work solely with clubs, groups and organizations on campus promoting the Nittany Lion Basketball team.  I am writing to your organization to introduce myself as a representative between your group and the team.  My main purpose for this season is to connect more with students to create better awareness about special events and home games through the relationship myself and Penn State Athletics Marketing wishes to build with your group. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n            Many students do not know that last season the Nittany Lion basketball team won 13 out of 17 home games at the Bryce Jordan Center, ending the season with a five home game win streak.  It was a season highlighted by wins over #7 Michigan State and the 17th-ranked Hoosiers of Indiana.  Penn State hosted the NIT champion Ohio State and also knocked off NIT quarterfinalist Virginia Tech in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge during the regular season.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n          This year we anticipate another great season as the Nittany Lions welcome back all five starters from the end of last season, as well as, three new talented young recruits. Therefore, our objectives as a marketing department are to reach out to on-campus student organizations like yours and work with them to inform our student body about the events we will be holding this year.  Aside from hosting some well awaited games against fellow Big Ten schools, we will also be promoting events such as Blue White Hoops Festival in the Bryce Jordan Center before the Michigan football game, the 2nd Annual THON Dodgeball Tournament this October and the student season ticket sale event at the HUB on October 1st with free food, fun and prizes! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n          With your help we believe we can improve the awareness for Nittany Lion Basketball.  Also, I extend an offer to come and talk to your membership about special opportunities for your group, for example, for performance groups who are interested in providing in-game entertainment this season.','2008 Fall',5,3,'2008-09-29',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(189,'Thaddeus Rutkowski','thadrutkowski@aol.com','Altered Persona','Each night, I put on my costume-a long cloth neck, two stubby horns, a patchwork quilt, and stilts-and went out to forage for leaves. I needed a long neck to reach the topmost morsels. But my neck wasn\'t going to get any longer from stretching it. No, I knew Darwinian theory. Creatures with long necks didn\'t get those appendages by reaching higher. They got them through natural selection. If I were going to survive, I\'d have to wait ages for a naturally long neck. But I didn\'t have the time, so I pulled on my extensions and my patchwork quilt, and I went out at night. I roamed my neighborhood. It was no Serengeti, but it had some trees. \r\nI drew some attention, but I didn\'t care. I was eating the greenest leaves, and my character began to change. I began to ruminate as I chewed. I began to think about savannahs, tall grasses, and acacias full of shoots. I could see over treetops, spot predators a mile away. I could wrap my tongue around twigs and strip them of edible parts. I was no longer in a suburb, straining to see over shrubbery, trying not to trip over trashcans, and keeping one step ahead of the authorities.

No, it was ugly, with night-scope eyes, a bullet nose, and a belly that touched the ground. \r\nHe or she probably thought the same of me. I must have resembled a prehistoric predator, all hair and glasses, with pasty, non-warty skin.\r\nRight off, I called the toad Tadpole, after its aquatic phase, and after myself. I had been called Tadpole more than once.\r\n     I looked for a way to keep the toad wet. There was a watering can nearby, but Tadpole wouldn\'t stop hopping around. So I picked up the can and chased the jumping thing, sprinkling as I went. Shortly, I gave up. Tadpole could stay dry.\r\nMy duties in keeping this pet would be significant. I would have to see about catching flies, calling a mate, finding a place to raise more Tadpoles-the things that toads do. It seemed like a lot of work.

I can no longer remember the last time a second past. I sleep for what feels like hours, hoping when I wake that a new second will have ticked away, continuously disappointed. My once short, dark hair now hangs long and gray, and my own memory of my face bears little resemblance to the shaggy bearded gentlemen I have seen in reflections, although I prefer to avoid them now. They are merely reminders of the inescapable doom to fall upon my body, likely before the clocks strike noon. If my shade remains, I pray limbo is somewhat more exciting, or at least less timeless.\r\n \r\nâ€˜Timelessâ€™ best describes my world, although it is not entirely accurate. Time is merely so slow as to be practically still. I was running at the time. It was almost noon, and I was late for an appointment, but at 11:58, something happened. No logical or even fantastic explanation has ever been given to me for why, but it remains 11:58 to this day. That last phrase obviously makes little sense, but it is hard for me to abandon my old vocabulary. I have walked the miles in between my home and the office hundreds of times now, and the irony of the task is not lost on me. Little is lost on me, in fact, for while my body withers away my mind remains intact, seems stronger than ever. I remember every moment since the incident, but perhaps I should, they add up to less than three seconds.\r\n \r\nFor the first few â€˜cyclesâ€™ (perhaps a more appropriate term than â€˜daysâ€™), I would visit my family, searching for sorrow or longing in their faces, but none exists. It will be least a half hour before the even remotely suspect anything, and that is far too long for me. My son sleeps off a hangover, my daughter stares at a still of reality TV with empty eyes, and my wife moans in ecstasy in my neighborâ€™s arms. Disheartening, perhaps, but my feelings towards all people are rather dulled. Their statuesque existence is so dehumanizing that my emotions towards them increasingly weaken, progressing towards absolute zero. \r\n\r\nI have decided waiting bores me, so I have taken to writing these thoughts down. I do not know if they will be at all recoverable. They will likely be dismissed as insanity, deranged creativity, or confusing nonsense to whomever finds them, but I do indeed grasp for ways to pass the time. My situation is nebulous enough that I am not sure if suicide will have successful results, but even if it fails, I am not far from wasting away unnaturally, so a final testament still serves a small purpose. I cannot avoid the urge to reflect, despite my hatred of reflections. \r\n\r\nWhile my life has been trapped in this handful of seconds, I am, in a way, free from the bonds of society that so plague the statues around me. We consistently, verging on constantly, measure ourselves in relation to each other, like the young couple. We depend upon each other for definition. I, however, am surrounded by a world that has absolutely nothing to do with me, and the nature of my existence becomes more and more disconnected from the standards I remember from my past.  \r\n\r\nIf we only focused on our own problems and possibilities without the need for comparison, but we have so built our lives around the idea of relativity that when we abandon such comparisons, everything falls apart, the structure breaks down, things become timeless.\r\n \r\nNo one is anything, we are merely ourselves. \r\n','2008 Fall',6,1,'2008-09-29',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(201,'David B.

After an overly filling supper, my head is throbbing in pain brought on by the altitude of this isolated city in the foothills of the Andes. Ari, a grinning industrious Ketchua boy of seven, grasps my hand with his leathery brown paw and drags me toward the raised bench, rag and black burnish at the ready as I sit, wearing my ragged old sweatshirt. \r\nâ€œMy name Ari. You speak English when I work, Gringo. I make your boots shiny!â€ he winks and chuckles. The chair is more than comfortable. The year-old Lanzera sneakers hugging my feet are nothing more than floppy scraps held together by cracked rubber soles and cloth laces, miles beyond their usefulness with long-disintegrated stitching. But Ari was born to swindle; an expert in quibbling with tourists and deftly flashing irresistible puppy dog eyes. I didnâ€™t stand a chance arguing, and may as well be wearing military boots as far as Ari cared. I ask him where he learned to speak English so well, and he smiles and points to the adolescent sitting on the sidewalk next to the throne reading a tattered novel.\r\nâ€œMi hermano Manuelâ€. He spits on my shoe and starts polishing. Manuel smiles and nods, teeth shining white in contrast to his smudged face.\r\n â€œHello. Excuse my rude brother,â€ says Manuel in a perfect American accent, â€œPlease rest. Iâ€™ll pour you some coca tea. It helps everyoneâ€™s headaches here.â€ He roughly cuffs Ariâ€™s head. Ari frowns and stares fiercely at Manuel in protest. Manuel pours the tea from a battered coffee pot into a Styrofoam cup and hands it to me, wiping his brow with a checkered flannel shirt. I thank him and introduce myself. Small children deftly kick a football around in the half-stone, half-brick alley. A man across the street with dirt-caked hair, bloodshot eyes and chasms in his forehead puts out his roach and coughs a pungent green-white cloud. He picks up a cheap guitar with only five strings and starts to fingerpick in a strange rhythm.\r\nâ€œTito Loco,â€ points out Ari. â€œhe do not like Gringos. Not like Manuel. Manuel he want to study English in Lima.â€ I nod and take a swig of the warm liquid while trying to evade Tito Locoâ€™s menacing, yet far off gaze. The coca tea is watery, but crisp with a faint taste of anise. Manuel pulls a small dated victrola from under the stand and begins to turn the crank, ever so slowly. A strangely fascinating droning sound underlies the piercing sound of needle scraping vinyl. I start to feel better as the tea takes hold. Ari is rubbing black shoe polish all over my white socks through the threadbare sneakers. I could care less.\r\nâ€œThis is a recording of los grillos or The Crickets,â€ says Manuel, â€œif I speed it up you can easily tell.â€ Manuel spins the crank faster, and I can tell that itâ€™s the familiar sound of nighttime crickets chirping in the woods. Tito Loco starts repeatedly sing in a beautifully uncharacteristic voice the word â€œGÃ©rmenesâ€ while continuing to twang the plastic strings. Tears roll out of the creases of his sun-baked face. A colossal white Christ-figure with arms outstretched in benevolence is silhouetted against the setting sun, giving the statue the appearance of being wreathed and haloed in shimmering Pentecostal fire.\r\nManuel cranks slower again and Iâ€™m transported, without moving into blissful delirium. Time itself seems to decelerate as I lethargically sip the analgesic tea and enjoy the haunting orchestra of molto ritardando crickets blended with Tito Locoâ€™s melodious serenade. Foreign constellations of the southern hemisphere begin to pierce through the indigo firmament. Ariâ€™s childlike voice fades and echoes, and for the briefest moment, I suspect I hear the breaking waves on the coast hundreds of miles away. I begin think strange thoughts in a hypnagogic trance. I feel almost as if Iâ€™m recalling memories from another conscience, reminiscing on a past that my person has never experienced. \r\nDazed, in a deep baritone, I say, â€œHere at the worldâ€™s table, our consciences are one.â€ I feel complacent, but have no control over my actions. I watch myself riffle through my wallet and hand the boys fifty dollars. â€œTonight we feast, muchachos, for tomorrow is the Summer solstice. Let us celebrate our freedoms at saqsay waman, before diligently resuming our studies.â€ With heavy eyelids, I sense that I understand the source of reason for everything, and wonder just when the world will wise up and decide scrape us humans off its back before drifting into a hypnotic slumber.\r\n','2008 Fall',7,1,'2008-10-15',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(209,'Max Moon','mjm5220@psu.edu','Organs','In my youth, when asked if I would rather live with a full heart and an empty mind, or with a full mind and an empty heart, I chose the first.

There was a greasy gravel parking lot carnival where I climbed on a spinning tea cup; a ride held together with paper clips, and didnâ€™t fasten a belt around my waist. There were teenage girls whose crescent moon blue fingernails fixed themselves on a spinning steering wheel across from me and spun the sunken cup faster, harder, faster, faster. I became so spellbound by those little sparkling half moons and a lilting chorus of laughter that my chin drooped to my chest until it eventually, obviously smacked the metal wheel in front of me and split. The spinning sensation never left. I hold onto the floor, onto the bed, onto the bar stool and often taste a viscous, coppery blood on my tongue. \r\n\r\n      There are times, now, when I sit in the middle of my bedroom during a blackout and stare myself down in the mirror. One person rarely sees herself eat or drink or smoke or sleep. The sound of oneâ€™s own voice feels only vaguely familiar in a room full of strangers. I donâ€™t understand the movement of my tongue around familiar words in the mirror. The inflection of â€œhello,â€ for instance. â€œGoodbye.â€ These are only examples. An ex-boyfriend told me I blinked too much on camera.\r\n\r\n      At the circus, nothing scared me but the grandness of space.\r\n\r\n      Before the tea cups, Iâ€™m on a VHS tape lifting a turquoise dress over my head in the middle of my lawn. Later, Iâ€™m running around second hand furniture naked as I came, brazen, unashamed, with a serious white wool scarf ripped around my throat. I still finger my throat when alarmed; I pull at taut skin.\r\n\r\n      My hand tears around the rim of a glass â€“ a hand that carried me from coast to coast as part of a desperate pair. These hands fingered a typewriter in a back bedroom closet when the turquoise dress would have swallowed me whole. I remember the staccato punch of black keys; letters garbled by my illiteracy. I chewed my tongue and delicately mashed keys with an increased intention and felt my cheeks grow hot and numb.\r\n\r\n      We lose vision and hearing, nicotine confuses taste buds and scents, renders them unreliable as the flu: is there any way to lose the touch of those keys under my fingertips? Can I forget what I must?  The mirrors I distrusted. Was it the fluorescent lighting that allowed me to forgive myself for so badly botching the experiment? Would there be a way to forgive the kick of metal against my palm? The immense weight of something so small? The swelling June heat etched into my skin but this thing in my palms stayed cold. Tears made my cheeks itch and more welled as I couldnâ€™t remove one hand from that Smith and Wesson .44 Magnum revolver to scratch; for fear that one wrist wouldnâ€™t be strong enough. I had an audience to my back, a target behind such an expansive grass and gravel lot that I couldnâ€™t trust any of my senses to find it. I kept my eyes closed but the kick of the trigger shot up my forearms and into my chest, and landed there something too dense to cough up.','2008 Fall',11,1,'2008-11-18',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(235,'Angela Farrell','amf5021@psu.edu','Pest Control','So welcome.

Everything on my body felt alien, as if my soul had been transported to a place outside of me and I was looking in on this fragile girl with her back curved against the wall; unaware whether she could move or speak, but entirely lost in her being. The intricately marked boxes of my former roommate needed to be moved and were blocking all of the light that typically saturated the cracks in the wooden floorboards where my bare feet swept back and forth.  The light would come back, incongruously enough, once his possessions were gone.  \r\nI am counting the minutes until the neighbors fall into their bed, touching the wall Iâ€™m facing from the other side and drinking in each otherâ€™s scents and tastes like theyâ€™ve never spent a goddam night in bed before.  â€œItâ€™s always something new for us,â€ the girl tells me when I see her in the grocery store.  â€œHeâ€™s a brilliant surprise that I keep unwrapping and discoveringâ€.  I grab the canned vegetables and stare at her as if sheâ€™s speaking German.  Her face is absurd and shaped like a bedpan thatâ€™s been used by every patient in the psychiatric ward where she works.  I touch her arm and tell her I have to get going, but that it was a pleasure seeing her.  Itâ€™s her routine to shout down the aisle something about meeting for a drink soon and mine to pretend I never heard a thing.  At least weâ€™ve got that in common.\r\nI hear the clamor of the locks and know heâ€™s back to grab the rest of his things.  The boxes are moving and the waves are swelling in my eyes, but I donâ€™t know how to move again.  The ghosts are all around me, just like he said.  Heâ€™s in the other room and in this bed at the same time, brushing my hair out of my eyes and wiping away the tears while the boxes keep moving back and forth from the door.  I know my ghost is in the room with him, sitting on the floor in his flannel shirt and sipping coffee while he tries to pretend sheâ€™s not watching his departure.

When a breeze came by, it would shake the branches, and soon we\'d have a lush carpet of lily- colored petals to cover the ugly cracks in our driveway.\r\n\r\n           In the summer, there were weeds to be pulled from that very bed and no school to save us from the job.

He\'d cry \"guts!\" and I\'d wrinkle my nose in disgust happily.\r\n\r\n           In the winter, there was snow. The blue prints for the small impregnable white fort with the built in bookshelf (his idea) were left on the kitchen table and accidentally thrown out. I was too young to shovel snow, and a girl.

Inescapably drawn toward its flickering glow I reluctantly joined the perimeter of five people.  They stayed with me for years through their sheer strength of character.\r\n	First there was Richard.  He saw the island as a place to perish safely through a self-perpetuated haze of kava and alcohol. Each day would dawn bearing fresh opportunities to blind himself to his faults and failures via substance abuse.  It quickly became apparent that he brushed off all his insults by labelling them â€˜sarcasm.â€™ He was like a one-man comedy act lacking in humour, continually reiterating the same anecdotes and quips.  When he began to run out of content it was time to seek a new audience.  Richard left soon after he was caught stealing a golf cart from the Japanese resort on the west coast.  In a psychosomatic panic, he imagined he could use it to drive across reefs all the way home to Australia.\r\n	The island was dominated by gratuitous dog fights and picture-perfect sunsets every evening, but Dean didnâ€™t notice either of these because he was too busy playing footy and lying about in hammocks getting stoned.  The only reason he left the island was via canoe, to go spear fishing - a sport he enjoyed far too much.  Although he eagerly embraced experience, he sought it through selective imagination.  He had this uncanny ability to convince himself that his own brand of truth was what actually transpired.  Dean seemed chuffed by the idea that the local community profited from the touristsâ€™ cash.  As though his holiday itself had built churches or directly upgraded schools.  \r\n	Sarah couldnâ€™t help wondering if the sight of lewd and staggering foreigners periodically face-planting into the sand of every beach was worth the fiscal reward of their presence.  As an ecologically-minded castaway, she preferred circumnavigating the currents around the island on a giant log of driftwood over the more popular options of jet skiing and wakeboarding.  The crashing breakers both frightened and attracted her, visible by day and interrupting her dreams all night.  Her sole purpose there was to â€˜chill.â€™  Yet Sarah was frustrated to still find herself trapped in an eternal paroxysm of rage over trivial events beyond her control.\r\n	Alexâ€™s life choices were becoming more unscrupulous, yet somehow less humiliating.  She drank Bounty rum like water, often finding herself too drunk to work out the complications of basket weaving or manage a sufficient dive off the pier.  When she got wasted she seemed to resemble a small, stunned animal of some sort.  Her skin was comparable to that of a potato, baked in oil for months under a tropical sun.  Alexâ€™s only apparent forte was beach volleyball, and she proudly claimed invention of the ingenious rule where the winners got to dump sand in the losersâ€™ beer.  Most of the men she associated with were classified as â€˜Just a bit of messy drunken sex.â€™\r\n	Kevin was obviously the most stable of the five.  He had seen every sunrise and sunset for nine months straight so far.  He battled forest fires all across America for five months out of the year so he could afford to relax in paradise for the remaining seven.  Except paradise, in his mind, was more aligned with places like Alaska, or perhaps the Canadian wilderness.  The question of how he ended up on this godforsaken strip of hot sand with a bunch of runaway backpackers seemed a perplexing enough reason to stay and see it out for a little while.  Before leaving Kevin buried my digital camera in the sand next to our last bonfire.  â€˜Why attempt to document illusion,â€™ he asked, â€˜why remember any of this ever actually happened?â€™\r\n','2009 Spring',1,2,'2009-01-21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(263,'Kristen Moon','kmoongirl@yahoo.com','Waiting','At first the goal seemed viable.  Out of work and overseas, Lucas found himself responding to wanted ads for wait staff.  A couple of months here or there would prize him a ticket home in no time.  The hours would be flexible and hopefully the tips would compensate for the dull monotony of redundant table service.  Lucas was actually quite looking forward to a acquiring a position of little stress and even less responsibility.\r\n	At first, Lucas managed to take pride and his work and enjoyed constantly meeting new people.  He found that folding serviettes an hour before every shift relaxed him into a pseudo-meditative state and the hours drifted by at a reasonable rate.  As the weeks wore on, however, Lucas began to take note of some slightly alarming alterations.\r\n	It began with the nightmares.  Every morning heâ€™d recall devastating mountains of cutlery waiting to be polished or miles of tables teeming with impatient customers.  Later, Lucas started noticing an undeniable dissipation of character. He developed a disturbingly subservient attitude towards all of his non-professional relationships, as though his only purpose was to please and appease those who surrounded him.  Conflict, in general, seemed to Lucas as intimidating as the endless stretch of shifts that were stacked before him.  He began to compulsively count down the days, eagerly awaiting the demise of his existence as a waiter.\r\n	After working weeks of consecutive twelve hour shifts Lucas began to recognise physical inhibitions as well.  Every step he took was heavy and defeated as though his entire purpose of motion was, in itself, debilitating.  His stature became slumped and his bent presence only seemed to exacerbate the docile sense of passivity that pervaded the way he approached and spoke to everyone.\r\n	By the time he finally purchased a ticket and settled into the airline seat Lucas knew that his time in the hospitality industry had changed him irrevocably.  When the pitiable stewardess came around, politely proffering tea and coffee, Lucas could only reflect her numb smile and request coffee with no sympathy.\r\n','2009 Spring',1,3,'2009-01-21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(264,'Kristen Moon','kmoongirl@yahoo.com','Substitute','Lucy got out of bed when her alarm sounded.  She painstaking withdrew clothes from her wardrobe, but with no deliberation over what to wear.  She arranged some semblance of a lunch and spooned down a bowl of cold cereal while standing in her dark kitchen.  She gathered miscellaneous school books and prepared to approach the harsh, bright morning.  With intense trepidation Lucy turned the handle, dreading the day she was about to face with every ounce of her being.  For as many years as she can remember, Lucyâ€™s mornings have been the same.  \r\nLucy trudged up the stairs toward school, concentrating acutely on the sound of her footsteps.  She contemplated whether the sound of footsteps going toward school were any different from the sound of footsteps going away from school.  In homeroom Lucy stood up for the Pedge of Allegience, then forgot to sit down again because she didnâ€™t realise it was over.  On the way to first period she smiled at the sound of slamming lockers.  They were loud.\r\nA student was late for her first class.  When she requested his pass the student retorted with a nasty comeback that sent the class into howling peals of laughter.  Lucy laughed along with them.  She felt a tiny bit happy knowing that she cooperated in an exchange of words that increased someoneâ€™s self-esteem.  A lot of people in the world should feel proud of themselves more often, Lucy thought.\r\nAs the lesson progressed slowly, excruciatingly, Lucy wondered why the students who talked the most actually shared very little worth saying.  Lucy secretly contemplated how the class would react if she suddenly morphed into an oppressive, dominating presence â€“ a teacher who could dictate authority and sway studentsâ€™ attitudes with a simple glare.  By lunchtime Lucy found that the entire morning had passed completely without registering anything significant.  In fact, the hours were a complete void in her memory.  \r\nLucy had always considered the high school cafeteria one of the most frightening places in the world â€“ the high pitched din, the overcrowded mass of unstructured student body.  She found herself retreating outdoors, despite her responsibility as the lunchtime monitor.  She smelled cigarettes and began walking in the opposite direction, eager to avoid any confrontations.  She found this passive philosophy so co-operative that she implemented it into all of her afternoon lessons.\r\nAs the last bell sounded Lucy drifted toward the front of the school.  The chatter of students and colleagues surrounded her, but Lucy was convinced that she wasnâ€™t talented enough to talk and walk to her vehicle simultaneously.  She was content to listen to the bits and pieces of conversation that drifted her way.  Topics ranged from the acquisition of prom dresses to denied party invitations to the latest violent films gracing the screens of the local cinema.  Undeserved detentions were protested and a crush was unveiled only to be met with scathing laughter.  Lucy felt a tiny bit sad, but how could she go on feeling sorry for herself when there were so many other people in the world to feel sorry for?\r\n\r\n','2009 Spring',1,4,'2009-01-21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(265,'Joseph Moon','jwmoon@verizon.net','Forces','knowledge washes over the sand grain of my existence\r\nas the ocean upon the shore\r\nnew truths revealed with each crashing intrusion\r\neach different and even more amazing than the last\r\ndislodging me from my heart\r\ndrawing me down out and away\r\n\r\non wild windy wave Iâ€™m tossed\r\ncast away and lost\r\nused as a tool to abrade the immovable\r\never present but now slightly diminished\r\njust from my passing\r\nchanged but still not moved\r\ndoes it know?\r\n\r\nrealizing that which changes not as the truth\r\nalways there to receive me again\r\nreturning to nestle amongst those of my own kind\r\nchanged yet somehow the same\r\nrediscovering my heart\r\nclinging mightily to each other our collective strength in numbers\r\nnot to be drawn away again\r\n\r\nreaching out to those being swept away\r\nentranced by the ever yet never new lie\r\nknowing there is no way to hold on in the face of such power\r\nletting go the ultimate act of love with the wisdom gained in experience\r\nthat they too will return to find themselves at last\r\ngolden grains upon the beach of time\r\nknowledge forsaken for what it is not\r\ntrue love','2009 Spring',1,5,'2009-01-21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(266,'Benjamin Schmitt','bens25@live.com','That Day','The woman takes a last look at the burning photo of her children before jumping out of the World Trade Center\r\nWhen she hits the air\r\nHer tears fly up\r\nHer arms spread\r\nThere is nothing\r\nM    O    R   E\r\nNo thoughts\r\nShe dies suspended in the air\r\nHer spirit parts her body at the 53rd floor\r\nAnd the remains crash down to the future\r\nTo be remembered in posterity\r\nOh how that body has been used\r\nParaded\r\nAlchemically transformed into a rallying point\r\nThousands of blood-soaked flags grew on her gravesite\r\nAnd then spread \r\nTo the four corners of the U.S.A.\r\nOutnumbering trees in Oregon\r\nAnd lobsters in Maine\r\nThey grew and grew and grew\r\nUntil there were so many that they muzzled our mouths and blindfolded our eyes\r\nAnd all the while \r\nIn what is known as the past\r\nBut is in fact happening right now\r\nBecause time itself is the measurement by which we keep ourselves from going insane Because the speed of light does not know day and night\r\nBecause all history is happening simultaneously\r\nAs she stared out that window\r\nHer mind grasped an important idea\r\nThat there is no pre-9/11\r\nOr post 9/11\r\nOne historical event does not change everything\r\nIt merely illuminates what has always been there\r\nAnd that is life and death\r\nA moment when you are sitting in your office sneaking emails to your lover\r\nAnd a moment when your office is on fire and you are forced to make a choice between deaths\r\nAnd it is because these moments are connected\r\nThat the universe functions so flawlessly\r\nAnd it was this insight she gained before her soul came flooding out of her ears \r\nAnd up into the sky\r\nAnd it is this insight we lack\r\nAs we still mourn her death\r\nas the symbol of our rage, our age\r\nforgetting the human being\r\nWho painfully leapt out of reality\r\n','2009 Spring',1,6,'2009-01-21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(267,'Benjamin Schmitt','bens25@live.com','Venus Cunnilingus','I am no Dr. \r\nBut I do give monthly check ups to the rats in my apartment\r\nI am no priest\r\nBut I do perform the last rites on whales blowing gallons of toxic waste out of their blowholes\r\nI am no prophet\r\nBut I do sell the truth to any greedy American who is man enough to swallow it and ask for seconds\r\nI am no intellectual\r\nBut I do like drinking wine and discussing the literary merits of comic books with ten year olds\r\nI am no racist\r\nI swear I love everyone equally, everything is okay, no Iâ€™m not just saying that, no I would never call you that, donâ€™t lock me up donâ€™t sue me I love everyone canâ€™t you see this diversity tolerant smile, yes I know my teeth are white, okay stop;

It wasnâ€™t until Dr. Matthews was on the verge of leaving, however, that he was struck by a vision of perfectly balanced beauty and grace. A woman, tall and pale, stepped away from the crowd and yawned intensely.  After two hesitant steps she suddenly careened into an exquisite faint that left her collapsed in a vulnerable heap of splayed attire surrounded by the scattered contents of her handbag.\r\n\r\nA series of startled exclamations erupted from the people surrounding the nearest sculpture, and in no time the unconscious woman was encircled by a murmuring crowd of concerned gallery patrons.  Dr. Matthews also found himself drawn toward the young lady, as though she were the most recently revealed addition to the featured artistâ€™s collection.  When it became clear that no one from the crowd was going to step forward to claim this young lady as an acquaintance, Dr. Matthews took the liberty to announce his profession and check the womanâ€™s pulse.  The audience dispersed as quickly as they had congregated, collectively relieved that there was a qualified individual available to resolve such an awkward situation.\r\n\r\nDr. Matthews gathered the woman into his arms as she regained consciousness with a flutter of eyelashes.  Her eyes were blue and they focused intently on him.  As he helped her stand, a light blush spread across her face.  She immediately began apologising profusely, apparently ashamed of interrupting the quiet sanctity of the art gallery with such a flagrant display of human weakness.  \r\n\r\nDr. Matthews smiled, exuding patience as she tenuously attempted to extract her elbow from his grasp.  â€œRelax, maâ€™am.  Iâ€™m merely escorting you to the nearest cafÃ© so you can revive yourself with food or beverage.â€\r\n\r\nShe shook her head as though emerging from a fog.  â€œOh really, itâ€™s not necessary.  This sort of thing happens all the time, unfortunately, and Iâ€™ll be all right. Honestly, I can take care of myself.â€  Her voice was high and breathless, her tone unconvincing.\r\n\r\nâ€œI must insist, my dear, itâ€™s no trouble at all.  Perhaps your blood sugar is lowâ€¦ a cup of coffee will have you feeling right in no time.â€  The woman was eventually persuaded and delivered a quavering smile across the table to Dr. Matthews as the waitress placed coffee in front of them.\r\n\r\nâ€œNow, itâ€™s hardly appropriate for me to diagnose you, but letâ€™s just run over your symptoms for curiosityâ€™s sake.  You mentioned that you faint often?â€\r\n\r\nThe peculiar woman began tearing sugar packets to shreds as she explained her affliction in a distracted, offhand manner.  â€œIâ€™ve had these episodes ever since I was a child.  Itâ€™s as though I suddenly perceive this extraordinaryâ€¦lack.  The entire atmosphere feels heavy and I find myself simultaneously drowsy and overwhelmedâ€¦the air feels unbreathable and everything becomes muted and slows down like the whole world has been submerged underwater.  Then my head goes all fuzzy and this darkness engulfs my vision and the next thing I know Iâ€™m on the ground with some heroic stranger attempting to revive me.â€  She suddenly stopped speaking and stared down into her lap as though rebuffed.\r\n\r\nDr. Matthews couldnâ€™t help placing his hand lightly over hers. â€œWhat youâ€™ve described to me sounds like what is commonly referred to as hyperventilation syndrome.  Some people develop unhealthy breathing patterns until an excessive loss of carbon dioxide upsets the pH balance of their blood and they faint.  The cause could relate to any number of anxieties such as stress, large crowds, feelings of claustrophobiaâ€¦Tell me, is there anything you can think of that may possibly contribute to this state of mind which you endure?â€\r\n\r\nShe laughed suddenly, ridiculously, as though expelling something outrageous. â€œYes, of course, that must be the reason.  I subconsciously reduce myself to an unconscious state in order to escape daily social realities.â€  The woman abruptly stood up and extended her hand.  â€œIâ€™d like to thank you for your help, sir, youâ€™ve been a perfect gentleman.â€\r\n\r\nShe dropped some notes on the table and walked quickly out of the cafÃ©, leaving Dr. Matthews staring bewilderedly into his coffee, wondering how he could have possibly offended the fragile woman.\r\n','2009 Spring',1,8,'2009-01-21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(269,'Bernadette Perchalski','bap5126@psu.edu','Silver Wave','(art)','2009 Spring',2,4,'2009-01-28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(270,'Charlee Redman','cmr5291@psu.edu','Nameless One','(photography)','2009 Spring',2,5,'2009-01-28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(271,'Charlee Redman','cmr5291@psu.edu','Nameless Two','(Photography)','2009 Spring',2,6,'2009-01-28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(272,'Charlee Redman','cmr5291@psu.edu','Nameless Three','(Photography)','2009 Spring',2,7,'2009-01-28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(273,'Teresa Chuc Dowell','tcd3942@lausd.net','Orchids','Sprays of pure white flowers, open and airy, in the full sun - angels...\r\nAdoption\r\nIt was a sunny day; the clouds high and white in the sky stretched out like cotton candy. The grandma that I would never \r\nmeet held my mom, just born, in her arms and gave her to the couple that would become my grandparents. During the war, Por-por (maternal grandma) wrapped my mom, three years old, in a carrier on her back, tied the ends tightly around her, and ran away from bombs and burning houses. At the age of fourteen, my mom began to work to suppport her parents, because they were old, couldn\'t work and could hardly read or write. She and her friend waitressed at a local restaurant in Saigon, walking there and back each day upon the warm grey pavement, wind blowing patterned sheets hung \r\nto dry outside of makeshift houses.  \r\nHow My Mom Met My Dad\r\nMy mom\'s family was very poor. They lived in a communal building with ten other families, each having one room. There was a hallway with five rooms on each side and a bathroom at each end of the hallway. My dad\'s family lived in a two-story house; they had chaffeurs, maids, cooks, nannies, and gardeners. My dad visited my uncle\'s record shop in the mall near \r\nthe restaurant where my mom worked. He noticed her walking everyday to and from work with her friend. My dad followed along on his motorcycle which frightened and intimidated my mom. She was reluctant to speak to him, because she was afraid that he was one of those \"player\" types. My dad asked his sister to help introduce him to my mom. My dad\'s sister sold icecream at a store nearby. My mom and my aunt greeted each other each morning and evening. They  began to chat with each other. Soon, my aunt introduced my mom to her brother, my dad. They did not go on a date alone for a while. They went to a theatre to watch a movie with friends and my aunt until my mom got comfortable enough to start dating my dad. My mom continued waitressing for six months until my dad introduced her to his brother who owned a record shop and she worked there selling vinyl records half the day and studying English the other half. My grand uncle (my \r\ndad\'s eldest brother) was generous and paid for my mom\'s English education. My mom said that my dad wanted my mom to have more opportunities, so he wanted her to learn English. Dad would take mom to work and pick her up from work on his motorcycle. After dating for six years, my parents wanted to get married, but my paternal grandma initially did not like my  mom, because of her social status and didn\'t allow my parents to get married, but my dad\'s eldest brother, my grand uncle, who had paternal authority after their father passed away, granted my parents permission to marry. \r\nChrysanthemum\r\nChrysanthemum is a flower we put on the altar for the dead. Chrysanthemum flower, when dried, is used to make a tea that is good for sore throats and for cooling the heat in one\'s body. I place a fresh yellow chrysanthemum petal on my tongue. The fragrance fills my mouth and all its promises.\r\nVietnam War\r\nFor eight years, the war ransacked the country and killed many people. Amidst the sounds of helicopters and turmoil, life had to continue. My dad taught my brother French and he quickly learned. Towards the end of the war, my mom\'s belly began to grow with me inside. I must have felt the earth\'s vibrations as the bombs dropped and people screamed; they say we can sense things when we are in the womb. The soil was a cemetery. At the end of the war, in 1975, my dad was summoned for \"re-education\" where he stayed for nine years. My mom was still pregnant with me and gave birth to me without my dad by her side. Soon afterwards, Por-Por watched my brother and I while mom sold soybean juice on the street. My dad was still in concentration camp. For a whole year, my mom did not know where they took my dad. She wondered if he was dead or alive. She heard rumors of prisoners being made to find underground bombs and who died when the bombs were accidentally detonated. \r\nBetween\r\nWe believe in flowers.

Spike the shovel into the hardened soil and lift and lift enough room for a seed.\r\nUnited States of America\r\nMy dad was still in concentration camp. We needed to leave Vietnam because it was not safe for us; we were of Chinese decent and there was increasing discrimination. Also, we were landowners and my mom had worked at an American company. The wind, the ocean waves, and hope took my mom, brother, and I, in the next couple of months, on a freight boat across the Pacific along with 2,500 other people fleeing the country. Mom gave her jewelry from my paternal grandma to her adoptive parents; she didn\'t know if we would survive the ocean voyage. We were traveling into the unknown and we didn\'t have any money. When mom first arrived in  America, she went to study English for eight months. She got a job afterwards. She only had a few cents upon arriving in the U.S. Mom worked the night shift at Bank of America from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m., ten hours a day, 40 hours a week. She prayed to Buddha every day for my dad\'s return. After nine years, my dad came to the U.S. and our family was finally reunited.\r\nOrchids\r\nPots of orchids appeared in the house and the garden. Vibrant yellow, pink, red, blue, and purple. The leaves were like streams of green water frozen like the water of a fountain suspended in air.\r\nGong-gong, Por-por\r\nMom sent money back to Vietnam for her adoptive parents. They were unable to come to the U.S., because there were no documents linking their relationship. Her parents adopted a son who lived with them, but gambled and stole from them. My mom saved up a few thousand dollars and had a house built for her parents, but the son gambled it away, locking my \r\ngrandma up and forcing her to sign the paper for the house. When my mom went back to Vietnam to visit her parents, she was scared that the son would try to kidnap her, steal her passport, or try to blackmail us. My mom gave the son and his wife money to take care of her parents. She bought the wife a sewing machine, she bought her parents an electric rice \r\ncooker. A few days after she left Vietnam and came back to America, my mom found out that the son sold the rice cooker. Mom always tried and tried to get her parents to come to America, but she was not able to because her last name was different from her adoptive parents\'. Her family name wasn\'t changed when she was adopted because her adoptive parents thought that she would eventually marry and have a different last name anyways so they didn\'t bother changing the last name. Not having her adoptive parents in America was one of my mom\'s greatest disappointments. After \r\nGong-gong and Por-por both passed away, there was a Buddhist ceremony held for them in Vietnam and then their ashes were sent to America buried in a plot of land my mom bought for them. She consoles herself with the thought that they were, in the end, able to come.\r\nScarves\r\nMom knitted scarves for us; scarves the color of ocean with a touch of sunrise and scarves the color of dark forests. When I visited my parents, I saw Mom sit with a pattern and a notepad and, occasionally, she made a mark on it to keep track of her knitting. My sons and I joyfully wrapped the finished scarves around our necks. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n','2009 Spring',2,1,'2009-01-28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(274,'Benjamin Schmitt','bens25@live.com','Pagans at the gates','Shadows\r\nMurmurs\r\nTerrors in Lutheran nights\r\nCan you hear?\r\nOver there?\r\nAn army builds itself\r\nIn the gullies and the bogs\r\nSCIENCE that brave slayer of dreams\r\nAnd RELIGION mighty killer of imagination\r\nLook up from their blood soaked texts\r\nBillions of ants have descended upon Rome turning the Vatican into their palace\r\nIvy covers the buildings of Times Square, trees grow on the floor of Wall Street\r\nBirds gawk and shit on Americans wherever they can find them\r\nSquirrels attack advertising agencies in Los Angeles with acorns\r\nThe return of the woodsman\r\nYouth exiled by lack of substance form their own communities high up in the trees\r\nThey rub the prickly bark and it is a more tender moment than any of them ever found in the company of their parents\r\nSCIENCE knows he is right but he is scared\r\nHis creations are diseased accelerators of Armageddon\r\nSCIENCE cannot exist alone\r\nHis older brother RELIGION is dying\r\nRELIGION\r\nYou know him,\r\nThe comedian who mocked us until we could no longer feel comfortable in our own skin\r\nThe lounge singer who made us deny ourselves in order to gain admission to his Vegas act of redemption\r\nBecause RELIGION is dying\r\nHe is using his last breaths to fight\r\nYes he fights SCIENCE\r\nBrothers always argue\r\nBut make no mistake that they are brothers\r\nFor they share a mother\r\nCIVILIZATION\r\nShe really got around back in the day\r\nSo we have no idea who the father is\r\nBut my guess would be US\r\nAnd I tell you what\r\nSCIENCE and RELIGION must have one hell of an Oedipus Complex cause theyâ€™re killing US\r\nAnd while they scream and moan and bicker and stew\r\nMountains are climbed\r\nLevels of awareness are attained\r\nAnd the perfect breasts of MAGIC arise out of a mountain lake dripping from the cold depths\r\nShe is looking to make SCIENCE her man\r\nCause lets face it\r\nThat guy needs a woman\r\nUp until now he has been all but sterile\r\nConstantly arguing with his brother\r\nAnd inventing gadgets to make US happy but which are never quite able to please\r\nMAGIC rides here on a pale horse\r\nShe carries a sword once drowned with Atlantis\r\nHer nubile body rides naked at dawn\r\nMaking for the final hour\r\nAnd if you listen carefully\r\nYou can hear\r\nHer horse neighing and running towards the city gates\r\n','2009 Spring',2,2,'2009-01-28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(275,'Kristen Moon','kmoongirl@yahoo.com','Attempted Spontaneity','The man exhaled and watched the smoke waft slowly towards the ceiling of his sparsely furnished studio apartment.

I won\'t find her.\r\n	Oh, how I miss you, my sweet Erzulie, the lantern of my night, the breathless ache in my wanting; I still catch myself thinking that you are there still, across the valley there, on the hill, waiting for me. I can\'t believe that you died not knowing I love you, you must have known, you must still know.  I was waiting for a miracle that I wasn\'t sure would come, looking into the abyss of a life without you.

to be all literary with my copy of Pride and Prejudice, watching a steady dribbling of customers in and out of the front door, almost as annoying as the gurgling sounds constantly spewing from the double-mocha-espresso-latte-light machine, or whatever the hell it is. I feel a certain vengeful pride in that I have come inside and parked myself at the choice window table but have not bothered to order anything. I donâ€™t plan to, either-I plan on taking up space, the way stupid franchises like this take up the space that should have been reserved for trees.\r\n	No one notices me impinging on their available seating, or, if they do, they donâ€™t indulge me by asking me to move. In fact, no one talks to me until-\r\n	â€œMind if I borrow this chair?â€\r\n	I look up from flipping idly through the pages and see a pair of sea-green eyes looking at me, slightly crinkled with their sincerity. There is a man attached to them, a well-built man with wavy brown hair and a steaming cup of something in his hand. He uses those lame-ass cardboard cup holders, as if they could really prevent the heat from clawing its way through to his skin. He is smiling at me expectantly; I guess I might as well answer. \r\n	â€œNo. No one is using it.â€ The last few words come out with a whoosh of breath that sounds like a sigh. \r\n	â€œThanksâ€¦â€ He sets the cup down next to my aviators and picks up the chair by its arms, swiveling around to place it at the neighboring seat-free table. Halfway through the movement, though, he pauses, whips a glance at me, now page-flipping again, and returns the chair to its original position. He breezily sits down across from me, picks up his drink, and takes a slow sip.\r\n	Raising an eyebrow, I stare at him. He grins innocently back and swirls his coffee around. The morning sun is conquering the window, laying siege to the table and to his face. I see that it does not need any more sun, that it is the color of a just-beginning-to-get-toasty marshmallow. I blink at him, but he is still there. I am really tempted to ask the obvious (â€œWhat do you want?â€), but something shuts me up. I wait for him to speak first.\r\n	I donâ€™t wait long. â€œHi. Iâ€™m Jake Walters.â€\r\n	â€œLena.â€ I donâ€™t bother to give a random stranger my last name. \r\n	â€œLena,â€ he repeats slowly, tasting it like he tastes his coffee. â€œSo, Lena, how are you?â€\r\n	I continue to blink at him. As he takes regular draughts from the cup, I watch him in moronic silence and, for some reason, want to tell him how I am. I feel like this surfer boy without a shadow of self-consciousness would actually care that Iâ€™m currently failing out of half my classes at NYU, that I was recently kicked out of my friendâ€™s apartment and am now living in a one-room loft which features air-conditioning in the winter and heat in the summer, and is located above a pricey boutique at which one dress would cost two monthsâ€™ rent. I feel like heâ€™ll care that my documentary about the cityâ€™s sparse foliage (and the dire world problem it suggests) has been rejected by no fewer than twelve film festivals, including one on campus. I feel like heâ€™ll care about these things, but all I tell him, way too late after he asked, is, â€œFine. How are you?â€\r\n	He leans back in his chair, draining the cup. Plonking it back down on the table, he gives me another grin, as if no time at all had elapsed between his question and my answer. â€œIâ€™m not too bad! Itâ€™s a great day outside, my rentâ€™s not due for another two weeks, and Iâ€™m sitting here in Starbucks having coffee with a pretty girl.â€\r\n	I am about to point out that his â€œhaving coffeeâ€ is kind of one-sided when I realize that when he said â€œpretty girl,â€ he meant me. I am once again reduced to blinking at him. He looks pleasantly back for a while, then pushes back the sleeve of his button-down shirt to look at his watch. \r\n	â€œWell, Iâ€™ve got to head out,â€ he announces, standing up and taking the cup in one hand. â€œI have to be there when the repairman comes.â€ He doesnâ€™t bother to explain where â€œthereâ€ is. He pushes his chair in, and he is grinning that grin again. â€œIt was nice to meet you, Lena.â€\r\n	Since Iâ€™m still blinking, he strolls up to the trash can and throws away his cup. He catches my eye as he pulls open the door and winks. Then he is gone, hidden from view by a passing taxi as he crosses to the sidewalk opposite. \r\n	I am flipping again, but unaware of the mini-breeze the pages make. For a few minutes, my mind is completely devoid of thought. I look out the window to the spot where he stepped into the street, then get up and order a skim-milk caffÃ© latte.

It would not get shorter until I cut it myself, until I got out the scissors and hacked. The problem was, I could see only the front of my hair, not the back, so I always gave myself a mullet.

I imagine that this is similar to the way a robot would clean the inside of her body.  I imagine this is what she would taste like too, a burst of metallic, followed by the aftertaste of cleaning supplies.   I remember years ago, going on dates with real girls.  Towards the end of the dates, I would sit in the driverâ€™s seat of my dadâ€™s car, a nervous little girl in the passenger seat.  Iâ€™d be making up small talk so my awkward high school tongue would have enough time to frantically slurp up all the foul tasting drool. Those were the days when I still carried a rotting corpse in my throat.  The dead body would cause my mouth to fill up with stale tasting saliva.  (This is of course the fancy way of saying, my breath tasted like an infant\'s hindquarters (like baby poop.)) It\'s funny now, thinking about my tongue running around, tidying up for the potential visitor, but at the time, I was just confused as to why my mouth would salivate as a runny diaper would during such a crucial moment in my adolescence.  \r\n            My sister and I used to have contests in order to determine whose breath was worse, or maybe it was to figure out who could smell the smelliest smell without flinching.  We would get centimeters away from the each other\'s face.  Then one of us would choose to breathe first.  The chosen one would open her mouth wide, conjure up the most horrid cloud she could muster and huff out a mixture of stomach air and hot gaseous saliva onto the other\'s face. Then, as whoever was breathed on would squinch up, we would judge. (People squinch up in disgust to make any potential entrance smallerâ€”smaller eye sockets, ear canals and anuses.  This makes it harder for the gas to infiltrate their bodies.)   Whoever caused the greater disgust, won.  This game usually ended with one of us carrying a thin film of slimy stink on the face, chasing the other person around the house to get revenge for the tonguing of an unsuspecting cheek.\r\n            I used to try inventing ways to rid myself of the odor.  I tried filling my mouth with saliva and swishing it around like mouthwash.  I tried drinking from water fountains (only to have my breath taste like the last six lips that had slurped around the fountain\'s metal fixture.)  I carried a pack of gum religiously and was constantly mangling a piece between my teeth.  I ate toothpaste for breakfast and gargled mouthwash the way the nurse at the dentist\'s office forced me to.  I learned how to make speaking with my hand over my mouth seem motivated.  (My nose was constantly itchy, of course.)  I avoided face to face interaction in conversations and as a result, I rarely looked at people when I talked to them.  Adults classified me as shy and I hardly ever went on a date with the girl I wanted to.  Then I figured something out.  All of my breath solutions had failed because I didnâ€™t understand the true cause of the stink-mouth.\r\n            I read somewhere that the word halitosis was first spoken in the late 19th century.  It stems from the word halitus, the word that means â€œbreathâ€ or â€œexhalation.â€  Halitosis therefore means the abnormal state of exhalation, the â€œcondition of having offensive-smelling breath.â€  This was an important moment in history because once the disease was coined as an official word, the dentists and the toothpaste companies could begin lying to us.  Brushing with a new toothbrush every six months will prevent Gingivitis. Gargling mint-flavored alcohol will kill 99.9% of bad-breath-causing-bacteria. Sliding a thin piece of ribbon between your teeth is awesome!  None of these things did much for me.  Ok, I did avoid Gingivitis, but other than that, it was all fabricated commercialism.  Selling tooth hygiene is very profitable.  The truth hygiene is a lot less lucrative.  They (those sneaky dentists) don\'t want you to know this, but I will tell you anyway.  \r\n            Bacteria do not cause bad breath.  Bacteria do exist in our mouths, but it is bad breath that actually attracts bacteria.  The real origin of bad breath grows out of a dying thought.  All thoughts die the minute they explode out of your brain.  If the thought is not released through some communication medium, it begins to rot inside you.  It begins to stink.  The stench then finds the closest unhindered hole to escape the body and voila! You have breath that smells like the underside of a hobo\'s sweaty pizza box blanket.  I won\'t bore you with the science behind all of this. The point of my story is that I guess you could say I miss those days when I hadn\'t figured it out yet.  I miss the awkward dates, the sibling games, the shyness.  Now that I constantly vent my thoughts, I have no more bad breath.  Everyone knows what I\'m thinking.  And it\'s an addiction.  I can\'t stop telling everyone everything.  Their satisfaction with my thoughts is so gratifying.  They love my thoughts.  The paradox is that without any thought left inside me, I\'m not very thoughtful anymore.  I\'m left thought-empty.

Each of 11254 volunteers were subjected to windless temperatures of 45Â°F and given identical coats which buttoned up the front and sported two front pockets, and were placed in a room containing: a picnic table, an evergreen tree, an empty bird-bath, and a small, lake-like pool. A control group of 2503 were subjected to sun-only conditions, for which the mean-time-to-coat-removal (MTCR) was 26 minutes and 43 seconds. The best MTCR was found to be 19 minutes and 30 seconds; this drastic improvement was acheived by maintaining sunny, windless conditions until the subject simply unbuttoned his/her coat and wore it more loosely, and then strong wind was focused on the front of him/her. This was tested on 5625 subjects. All other combinations of sun and wind were found to increase the MTCR beyond that of the control group.','2009 Spring',10,2,'2009-04-08',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(342,'David Rockwell & Chad Ostrowski','chad.ostrowski@gmail.com','Mammies Enormous Trinket','Cardamommy saw him walking through a pit of sauerkraut, becoming dried oregano.

She handed one to her father and unwrapped one herself.  She took small bites as her father struggled with the plastic wrap.

More, really, once you count the emotional death of those who lost people they loved or the soldiers who went to fight in the war. One moment was all it took to turn our world upside down, and again and again and again we forget what happened that day. Fire, smoke, and tears all ran together in a haze of days that seemed to last forever. Eventually, we learned how to get up and go to work and move on with our lives, but our every moment remained defined by that one second, everything we saw a reminderâ€¦ on the backs of cars and on t shirts and in every flag that we saw flying in the wind after  that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    And time moved on.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world is a different place now, but somewhere along the line, we forgot to remember what it felt like on that day. A moment of American pride and anger that we could be attacked like this vanished when the footage was taken off TV and the pictures werenâ€™t on the front page. We became lost in the frustration of a war that didnâ€™t seem to move forward. Politics and lies swirl together in an indistinguishable tangle, creating a world of confusion and ulterior motives. And we continue to forget that on that day there were two towers and three thousand lives lost.

She stood there and surveyed the situation; it wouldnâ€™t be hard to fix. She picked the glass out of the carpet and, after only a brief consideration, threw away the book on the ground. Maybe I shouldnâ€™t have hurled that at him.  She stripped the bed and washed the sheets, because they still smelled like sex. That was good, the way that in the midst of the yelling, he kissed her so hard, so passionately. But thatâ€™s over now, donâ€™t think about that. The only thing that she didnâ€™t know how to fix was her broken heart, which was sitting there, taunting her, on the desk. So she picked it up and put it in the back of the closet, where she didnâ€™t have to look at it all the time. I guess all thatâ€™s left to do is move on. \r\n\r\nThe blue sky matched his blue eyes and her blue jeans. Hand-in-hand they walked along the street, and there was something easy about their stride. She tossed her hair and he smiled at her and leaned down to kiss her cheek. She laughed at him and turned into the kiss. The busy street scene seemed to freeze while they savored the smooth kiss. I watched them walk down the street, still with easy walks and smiles and hand-in-hand. \r\n\r\nToday was the day it would all start again, and she knew it as soon as she woke up. Instantly, the first breath she took tightened the shackles around her heart. The weight settled in like an old friend that you hoped to never see again. Familiar with each other, she and the loneliness started in right where they had left off. With every step and every breath the chains tightened threateningly, daring her to take another step. But she continued walking forward, because there was nothing left to do. Every hand-holding couple she passed was like another shot to the heart. She hoped they knew how lucky they were, to be so young, so in love, and so close.  Meanwhile, he was a thousand miles away in another world, and there was nothing to do about that fact, except hold it, know it, and try to ignore it, but the chains around her heart wouldnâ€™t let her. So really, all there was to do was hope that she could go one more step without it overtaking her. Finally, she gave in, she gave in to the solitude and wept.\r\n\r\nThe smell of asphalt as my sneakers slap the ground.\r\nPale pinks and oranges streak the sky.

One Friday, her mother had a date, and the two of us decided to pass the time watching The Land Before Time in her family room. Adeline said she forgot a stuffed animal. My back was to the staircase, so when she came back down, I couldn\'t see that she had a lit candle in her hands. \"Look what Mamma left in her room!\" By the time I turned around, she was already tripping over the rug. It caught the flame and before I could think to tell her to get away, my bare foot was coming down against the carpet, hard, as if it were a spider I could squash. It was that easy, I realized quickly, for a little girl to start a damn fire, and with good reflexes, it was that easy to contain it. I threw out the rug, a small thing to wipe your shoes on more than anything, and told her mother that I had spilled her grape juice. I bought her a new rug. I told Adeline it was our secret, but her mother never called me back to babysit after that night. If I were to take off my shoe, now, in front of her, Adeline would recognize the mark on my foot. \r\n\"Adeline!\"\r\nShe slowed her walk but never stopped, turning her neck slowly to look at me, as if it were painful for her to do so. Her eyes were veined red and the skin under them was strained to accommodate the swelling. A caul of calm, or apathy, fell over her face.

I used to be able to, at home, I mean.  But Tucson is too hot.  The sun radiates through the skylight above her bed.  Then air in the room starts to feel too heavy and saturated, and I canâ€™t stand to stay under the covers that close to somebody else.  So I climb out of the bed, and she just moans, rubs her feet together, and bundles even tighter in the blankets.  I donâ€™t know how she does it, staying in bed when the room is that warm, but she does, sometimes for half an hour after I get up and sometimes until after lunch.  I donâ€™t mind at all.\r\n\r\n      When I moved in back in June, all I brought was a backpack with some white t-shirts, a handful of underwear, and a couple pairs of shorts.  I left my journal at home, but I didnâ€™t feel like talking to my mom, so I didnâ€™t bother having her ship it.  After a few days, we went to Wal-Mart so I could buy a journal and a toothbrush.  Hangers, towels, I bummed all that stuff from her parents.  I sleep in her room, and her mom does my laundry.  She even folds my socks.  These mornings feel like the only things that belong to me in this house.\r\n\r\n      Most days, I just lie on the loveseat in the living room and watch cartoons.  Then Iâ€™ll go outside and smoke cigarettes and look at the pictures in the newspaper til she gets up.\r\n\r\n      I donâ€™t mind the heat here, it doesnâ€™t make you sweat like it does back east.  Sometimes, I sit outside for hours doing nothing, I just picture myself melting or I pretend I donâ€™t exist.\r\n\r\n      On the days when her momâ€™s not working, weâ€™ll sit at the kitchen table and talk.  Sheâ€™ll be there, filling out checks to pay bills, and Iâ€™ll sip from a cup of coffee.  I like talking.  Her momâ€™s smart, not like mine.  I can talk to her about art or the economy or whatever else I can think of.  Plus, she never bothers me about our plans for after we graduate next spring.  Even though she tries to hide it, I know her mom thinks her daughter deserves someone better.  Sheâ€™s way too polite to say anything, but I can hear it in her voice sometimesâ€”she wishes her daughter was with a lawyer or a doctor, some kind of business man, not a writer.  I guess I know what she means, though, and I donâ€™t really blame her.  Her dad, I donâ€™t think he really minds either way, to be honest.  Donâ€™t get me wrong, he loves her, he really does, and I think he likes me well enough, but I donâ€™t think he cares a whole lot about who sheâ€™s dating.  Not too many guys trust their daughters like that.\r\n\r\n      God only knows what she sees in me.  Sheâ€™s a great girl, she really is; sheâ€™s smart and cute and wittyâ€”god is she wittyâ€”but thatâ€™s not what I like about her.  What I like is that sheâ€™s her.  Sheâ€™s her without me.  I mean, she likes me, I sincerely hope she does anyway, or what the hell are we doing?  She likes me, but she doesnâ€™t need me.  Sheâ€™d get on just fine without me.  Sometimes I wonder why she doesnâ€™t.  We have enough in common and all, but look at me.  I smoke too much, Iâ€™m a borderline alcoholic, and Iâ€™m going into my last year of a degree that wonâ€™t even earn me enough money to stay above the poverty line.  It makes me wonder if a shared love for red wine and an infatuation with words are enough for a relationship to last.\r\n\r\n      I try not to think about it too much; I canâ€™t, it would drive me nuts.  Iâ€™m just glad to be away from home for a bit.  I mean, it wasnâ€™t that bad, it really wasnâ€™t.  It just gets to you after a while.  My mom couldnâ€™t go five minutes without interrogating me about my plans for after college and then having a nervous breakdown, trying to convince herself that sheâ€™s ok with her son being a writer.  And whenever I did anything with my dad, he always had to bring his new girlfriend, the troll with the crooked teeth and bleach-blonde hair, wherever he went.\r\n\r\n      So what are we doing after we graduate?  I donâ€™t know.  Weâ€™re both looking at schools in DC or Baltimore or something like that.  Iâ€™m thinking creative writing, and sheâ€™s thinking law.  Maybe weâ€™ll both go to school around there.  Weâ€™ll get an apartment, just the two of us this time.  Go to yardsales to buy furniture, maybe.  Weâ€™ll eat Chesapeake Bay crabs for dinner and go to concerts on the weekends.  During vacations, weâ€™ll visit our friends from back home, wherever theyâ€™re going to school or working.  Weâ€™ll go all over the country, and I wonâ€™t mind driving everywhere because sheâ€™s afraid of flying.  Maybe weâ€™ll do that, I donâ€™t know.\r\n\r\n      All I know is that sheâ€™s gonna roll out of bed in an hour or two.  Her stone-blue eyes will still be half-closed, and her hair will be all over the place.  Sheâ€™s gonna plop down across from me at the kitchen table.  And sheâ€™ll be cuter than any girl in a tight dress at the bar.  Iâ€™ll get her a cup of cold coffee and stale croissants from yesterday.  Sheâ€™ll be too tired to talk and way too tired to make sense.  After she gets her caffeine fix, maybe weâ€™ll go for a drive.  To the bookstore with the dog-earred paperbacks and back issues of Poetry magazine or the Mexican place that makes huge burritos.  The highway leads straight out of here, and the mountains go on forever.  Where are we going?  I donâ€™t know.  All I know is weâ€™ll be together.','2009 Fall',11,19,'2009-11-12',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(472,'Kyle Carrozza','kvc5023@psu.edu','The Inverted Eye Looks Inside','(Photograph)','2009 Fall',11,30,'2009-11-12',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(473,'Kyle Carrozza','kvc5023@psu.edu','Near Canopy','(Photograph)','2009 Fall',11,24,'2009-11-12',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(474,'Kyle Carrozza','kvc5023@psu.edu','34.

On Sundays we would all line up on the pew, heads bowed as we let our minds fill with various thoughts according to our age, gender, and level of piety: the groceries we had to buy today, the movies we\'d like to see later, the dirty magazines we\'d snuck looks at earlier, or the young lady who worked at the library and inched her skirt way up as she smiled right at you last Tuesday. Mother, for example, thought only of God, and perhaps how God would penalizethat woman at the library who would smile broadly at my father as she inched her skirt way up. \r\n     Aunt Val skipped out on all of this. In the early days, I am told, she and her husband would dress up in their finest and throw open the doors, turning up their immodestly paced music so that the whole town knew that the couple was dancing through the house on a Sunday. When her husband died all too young (my mother was convinced it was because of his partaking in such sinful revelry) Aunt Val took to traveling a little ways out of town in her late husband\'s car, so that she could spend the day perched in a cafe, smoking and making conversation with those who were interested. She got a little older and took an even older lover, which was heavily frowned on by everyone above the age of twenty-five. I was ten at the time, and would sometimes feign sick so that I could skip church and go see her. In her silk robe with dark roses down the front, Aunt Val would prepare a sumptuous meal,  decandent with rich cream sauces and always accompanied by champagne. Even the table setting was lavish; her lover would drive out of town to bring her back birds of paradise for her vase and they used his mother\'s real gold silverware set to eat. Mother was furious when I accidentally let it slip that Aunt Val used her mother\'s bone china to serve the meal. \"Disgracing God, and His dead servant too,\" she\'d say as she kissed a photo of my grand-mama.\r\n    The night I turned twenty-two happened also to be the eve of my engagement, and a Sunday. Aunt Val had me called to her home. She gave me a robe to wear, silk with little butterflies roaming the sleeves, and she donned her own familiar one. She was a little past fifty-years-old, even if she said thirty-nine, but she kept her hair a lively auburn and she drank enough turmeric-water to keep even the smallest wrinkles at bay. As she poured a glass of champagne for each of us, she said in a voice that quivered with its own importance, \"I\'m getting old and you\'re the only one in this family with any hope. I need to pass on our ancestral way of life -- joie de vivre.\" She stopped to see if she had instilled the right mix of curiousity and reverence in me, and because she had, she kept going. \"Spend every moment of your life enjoying it. Eat, and savor your food. Sit, and savor existance. Everytime you move, feel your clothes moving against your skin. When you dance, enjoy every aspect of it, not just the music, and the man, but even your the way the balls of your feet glide across the floor. Do you understand?\"\r\n     I nodded, solemnly, not only because I understood the words she was saying to me, but because I wanted to keep the mood she was trying to maintain. Though I was old enough to know that a child should not question elders, and though I understood she was the teacher in this setting and I the student, I could not help but mention, \"But Aunt Val. We\'re not French.\"\r\n     She grinned, allowing her dimple to deepen and exposing a few glistening teeth. \"Yes, love, but you must learn to live from those who know how.\"','2009 Fall',11,18,'2009-11-12',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(482,'Swati Prasad','lookitsswati@gmail.com','Lame Haiku About Love!','\"No man\'s an island.\"\r\nI disagree (so long as \r\nI call you the sea).\r\n','2009 Fall',11,22,'2009-11-12',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(483,'Diane Kearney','dmk5220@psu.edu','A Race of Confusion','I try to write, ideas\r\nOverflowing\r\nWith thoughts and questions\r\nWord vomit\r\nUseless memories exploding in my head\r\nSeemingly boring words\r\nIf only I could tumble it out on the paper\r\nLike a purse on a table, but I find\r\nSynonyms running together\r\nAdjectives lagging behind\r\nPronouns watching the show\r\nWhile verbs keep track of time\r\nWasteful\r\nThey go nowhere\r\nAre written on a lost line\r\nDistraction\r\nAnd it begins again','2009 Fall',11,8,'2009-11-12',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);
