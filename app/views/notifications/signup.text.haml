== If you didn't make an account, then the editor probably signed you up. This is super cool because it will let the editor and you see everything you've submitted in one nice place, it will let the coeditor and you keep track of how everything you've submitted is scored, and when you have things published they will show up on your profile for everyone to see. Neat!
