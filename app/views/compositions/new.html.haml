    Your name will be removed when this is reviewed; 
    only the cheif editor will know you wrote this. 
    And only the assistant editor will know how people 
    score it. Everyone else has the privilege of 
    judging it objectively.

    Your whitespace will be preserved (line breaks
    and tabs). Soon you'll be able to add bold and
    italics and other fun stuff.
